Start with an empty canvas. Randomly dot it with ink. You'll get something like this.

DART THROWING IMAGE

But what if you want the placement of these dots to represent something organic? Something that requires space around itself to exist, or even just vies for resources with its neighbors: a forest of trees, a clustering of skin cells, or a tight packing of meteoric material that's accumulated over thousands of years.

Since every dot in the above image was selected at random independently of every other dot, clusters form, some even overlapping. There is nothing stop
