## Research Interests

Investigates how robotics and artificial intelligence can assist in the search for life throughout the universe. While with the **SETI Institute** working at **NASA Ames Research Center** I participated in experiments to improve autonomous drilling in extraterrestrial environments such as Mars and Europa.[^1]

Presently, I contribute to an open-source virtual lander testbed for Europa, and other icy worlds, called [*Ocean Worlds Autonomy Testbed for Exploration Research & Simulation* (*OceanWATERS*)](https://github.com/nasa/ow_simulator#ocean-worlds-autonomy-testbed-for-exploration-research--simulation-oceanwaters). OceanWATERS enables researchers to develop lander autonomy to address the challenges of missions on icy worlds in out the outer solar system.

In 2018, I participated in a year long idea incubator to explore novel methods of life detection that can be utilized in future NASA missions. My teams' concept leveraged cutting edge data science with existing astrobiology databases to detect patterns that uniquely indicate life.

## Game Design Philosophy

Games are an entire universe of artistic expression that classic board games and even modern computer games have only just begun to scratch the surface of. My game designs draw heavily from the physical sciences because those are ripe with intricate rules and emergent behaviors that readily adapt as novel gameplay mechanics. I seek to provide my players with an other-worldly experiences that can only be achieved through computer simulation. I believe that when we encounter novel forms of interaction it is a form of scientific exploration in and of itself.

## Current Work

<!-- UPDATE ME -->

My newest game project, [Kuiper](https://starrynightgaming.itch.io/kuiper), was started following a 10 year hiatus from game development while I focused on school and my work with NASA. It is inspired by research I did at the **SETI Institute** on the many varied forms of ice that are encountered when one ventures beyond our temperate planet.
