I am software engineer with degrees in physics and applied mathematics. After graduating from the University of Utah I was given an internship at **NASA Ames Research Center** in Mountain View, CA. The internship later turned into a position with the **SETI Institute** to continue my work with **NASA**. Through my job I had the privilege to travel with **NASA** scientists and engineers to remote locales of interest to astrobiologists, including: the [Atacama Desert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atacama_Desert#Comparison_to_Mars), [Rio Tinto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Tinto_(river)#Astrobiology) near Seville, Spain, and [Devon Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon_Island) in Nunavut, Canada.

Now days I work nearly full-time on game development projects, and only part-time on space research. This blog will see updates mostly about game development, some general coding adventures, and eventually some posts about my travels and work with **NASA**.

Game Design

Ever since I first played Super Mario Bros. 3 on the NES as a young kid at my grandmother's house I was hooked on gaming. I set out to create my own games by teaching myself programming starting in freshman year of high school (back before most high schools offered programming electives). About a year later I picked up GameMaker Studio and built **Maze**: a rudimentary top-down obstacle dodger with a soundtrack ripped-off straight from The Gorillaz's 2001 debut album (I wasn't really aware of copyright back then).

Continuing to experiment in Game Maker Studio, I built **Gravity Golf**: a physics puzzle game where the player is presented with a star system of planets, moons, [moon-moons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsatellite), comets, a wormhole, and a purple ball. The objective is to impart just the right initial push on the purple ball so that it navigates through the solar system using the gravity wells of these planetary obstacles and into the wormhole. Gravity Golf was my first venture into the physics games genre, and its been a big influence on the games I develop today.

By now the game industry is no stranger to the physics sandbox game, but I feel what is out there barely scratches the surface of what is possible. The physical sciences are deep with intricate rules that are ripe for game mechanic inspiration.

My latest project, [Kuiper](https://starrynightgaming.itch.io/kuiper), was started following a 10 year hiatus from game development while I was focused on school and my work with NASA. It is inspired by research I did at the **SETI Institute** on super low temperature ice. In it the player explores a far flung future where a space-stranded human race lives and dies by one of the most common resources in the outer solar system: water. The player takes the role of an ice-ship pilot with the power to harvest water ice from asteroids for armor, weapons, and propulsion. It has been at thrill to return to my creative roots, and I cannot wait to share my progress with you.
